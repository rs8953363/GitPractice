/*For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15
rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12
rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a
separate helper "public int round10(int num) {" and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same
indent level as roundSum().

roundSum(16, 17, 18) → 60
roundSum(12, 13, 14) → 30
roundSum(6, 4, 4) → 10
